Logic:

- Settings defaults being applied correctly?
- Edit team (pre-populating details & prevent guild change)
- Delete team (confirm correct team)
- Delete team player (no event firing?)
- Team name missing in emails (include guild[s] & positions too?)
- Guide viewing ("cordova.disusered.open - Invalid file URL")

Styling:

- Listing elements widths
